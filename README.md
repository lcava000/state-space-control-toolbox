# 🚀 State-Space Control Toolbox
### An interactive MATLAB toolbox for state-space control system analysis and design

## 📌 Overview  
**State-Space Control Toolbox** is a MATLAB script designed for analyzing and designing **control systems in state-space representation**. It includes tools for **stability verification, controllability, and observability checks**, along with **controller and observer design using Kalman and Ackermann methods**. Additionally, it provides **transfer function computation, Bode diagram plotting, and step response analysis**.

## 🎯 Features  
- ✅ **Interactive input** for matrices \( A, B, C \)  
- ✅ **Stability verification** via eigenvalues analysis  
- ✅ **Controllability and observability analysis**  
- ✅ **Controller design** using **Kalman’s method**  
- ✅ **Observer design** using **Kalman’s method**  
- ✅ **Controller design** using **Ackermann’s method**  
- ✅ **Observer design** using **Ackermann’s method**  
- ✅ **Transfer function computation** \( G(s) \)  
- ✅ **Bode diagram plotting** for system analysis  
- ✅ **Step response computation** for dynamic behavior evaluation
